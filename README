Tool and platform integrating multi-omics data search, clinical variant interpretation, and collaborative research tools to bridge the gap between genomic data and actionable biological insights.

Features implementations:
-- Context-aware search -> Prioritizes results based on clinical/research context  -> `core/search.py`  ->
-- Protein function prediction -> Uses ESM-2 embeddings for zero-shot prediction  -> `ml/prediction.py`  ->
-- Interactive genome browser -> Combines genomic, epigenetic, and clinical data  -> `visualization/genome_browser.py`  ->
-- Real-time collaboration -> WebSocket-based shared analysis  -> `api/websockets.py`  ->
-- Blockchain annotations -> Immutable community contributions  -> `data/integration.py`  ->

Deployment:
```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlite3 transformers torch plotly
uvicorn api.rest:app --reload # run api
```
